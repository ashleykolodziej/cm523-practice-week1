## How grading and feedback works

This repository uses Autograding to check the basic assignment requirements. Once you pass these requirements, [send me a link to the pull request in Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825). I'll give you additional feedback on things like performance and coding style, so you know how to improve your code for next time.
